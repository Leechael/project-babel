<p>Sometimes if you want to disable Sendmail on your FreeBSD server, you can try those two methods:
</p>

<p><ul>

<li>If you don't want to restart your server (In case of emergency):<br /><br />
<span style="font-family: Courier"># killall sendmail</span>
</li>

</ul></p>

<p><ul>

<li>If you want to disable Sendmail at the startup period, you'll need to add the following 4 lines to /etc/rc.conf :<br /><br />

<span style="font-family: Courier; white-space: pre;">sendmail_enable="NONE"
sendmail_submit_enable="NO"
sendmail_outbound_enable="NO"
sendmail_msp_queue_enable="NO"</span>
<br /><br />
And you'll need to restart your FreeBSD server.
</li></ul>
