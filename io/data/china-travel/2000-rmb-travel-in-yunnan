<p>It is RMB, not dollar or pound. And it is 2,000, not 20,000 or even more. I am a traveler and I got the license of english tour guide of China that I want to share my experiences on my blog. Taking a bit time to finish reading this article and you will find some useful information.</p>

<p>As we have read from some tour guide book, the most famous tourism route in Yunnan is Northwest route, including Kunming(Jiuxiang karst cave, Stone Forest), Dali, Lijiang and Shangri-la. There are a lot of plan for you to cover the whole places. I think we should start with the starting spot, Kunming.</p>

<h2>Kunming</h2>

<p>No matter how you arrive Kunming, you should find a place to have a rest. Here I recommand you to stay in international hostels in Kunming. You can check their information on website, but I personally advice you to choose Hump Hostel. It is located in the centre of the city and also the centre of entertainment, which means there are a lot of pubs and clubs around your place. Public transportation there is easy to get, you can go anywhere in the city conveniently. The fee of taxi starts at 8 RMB before 22:00 and 9.8 RMB after 22:00. Also, you can take a bus, but you should prepare changes (1 RMB to all
buses) because there is no ticket conductor. A main pedestrain street is near the Hump Hostel, there are 2 biggest shopping malls and a supermarket in thar area.</p>

<p>Then I think there is a place you can not miss where you will find the sense of home. It is Wenhua lane which has many cafes and some of them are running by foreigners. You can take Bus #2 #84 #98 to Jianshe road and walk 5 mins to the lane. The lane is beside the Yunnan University and you can find it easily I suppose. <strong>Salvadorâ€™s</strong> and <strong>French Cafe</strong> are my best recommandations on the Wenhua lane.</p>

<p>You will see the cigarettes here are very cheap than in your countries, but you will probably buy a fake pack. So if you want to buy, choose ones with the <em>Tobacoo Company of China</em> on them. You will also see some foreigners smoking marijuna, but I suggest you had better not smoke in public, because it is illegal in China. What if you want to purchase some, I will tell you later in the Dali chapter.</p>
